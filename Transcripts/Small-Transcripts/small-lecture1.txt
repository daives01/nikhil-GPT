 All right, welcome to animal and equine signs 445 folding management. What you all look like you're in the wrong room. Now, to CS445 introduction machine learning. Hi, my name is Nakeel Krishnaswamy. I am an assistant professor. So today's syllabus day. So nothing, nothing too intense basically all go through the syllabus and class expectations. And I will then go through like the first couple of simple Jupyter notebooks just to get us started wondering what the heck all this was about. I absolutely forgot the time and location of our class and so I went looking for them in the registrar, and then start God long distracted looking at all the other courses that are coded as 445 one of which is animal and equine signs 445 folding management. So, if I seem very tired and unshaven and punchy it's because I am which we will get to the reasons for that minute. Okay, so what is this course why we all here. This course covers fundamental concepts and methods in data analysis classification regression prediction. Also data visualization. This is going to be a mostly neural network focused class. The assumption here is that folks have taken CS345 or at least have a certain level of comfort in Python. So I will just go through the syllabus and describe you should talk. Basically, you will learn the principles of reading in data visualizing data examinings to data using statistical analysis on go through the syllabus and the course schedule in a moment to kind of, you know, familiarize you with the structure of the course. So you will be doing units on regression classification reinforcement learning, and then assorted other things and machine learning that we don't meet we fit in either of those. You will be doing a combination of experimentation and writing for your assignments. So again the assignment structure. We're also going to be using some latest features in Python, including Jupiter. So this entire class is based in Jupiter notebook so I hope everybody knows how to use those. If you don't. So maybe you can set up a tutorial. I would like to take a moment to let our TA introduce yourself if you want to say a few words. I'm Fira and my office hours would be every Thursday time to one and that's going to be in 120. 120 in the CS building. So I assume most of you are familiar with that if you're not if you go in the CS building that's one of those big labs just on the first floor. Okay, just out of curiosity. I know this class typically gets a number of students from outside the CS department so how many can you raise your hand if you're a CS major. So, I'm going to introduce most of you. How many of you are not CS majors. So, but a decent number of you. How many of your grad students from not CS. So, if you okay so this is tip, it's pretty typical. So, we often get a number of people who are are interested in applying computational methods to their to their field. What department are you in? And some some other people who raised your hands. Where, where are you from? Okay. And so what are you interested in working on? Okay, yeah, very, very, very data friendly and then you what do you work on? Okay, yeah, sounds sounds like you sound similar to people I have I've had before in this class. So hopefully you've heard good things. I think it's going to be a fun class. I enjoy teaching and I hope you enjoy learning it. Okay, so about me. This is my third year at CSU. So I'm kind of midway into my, my tenure, tenure clock. So I got my PhD five years ago at Brandeis University that's in Boston. My primary research area is actually natural language processing. So in addition to 445 I also teach CS 542, which is the graduate natural language processing course. I do research in multi modalities that is a combination of language and vision. I also do a lot of work with intelligent interactive agents. So, you know, chat bots, but also more sophisticated things that actually learn to recognize gesture and interact with people in real time. I also do have done a lot of research, research recently into the geometric properties of machine learning representations. So if I start throwing the term embedding around a whole lot. That's basically what I'm referring to as the representation in the high dimensional space that is contained within a machine learning model. And we've applied some of this to low resource languages and natural language processing over languages that are not well represented that don't have a lot of data available. That are maybe not not as widely spoken as some of the usual suspects like saying which are Chinese or Spanish. I direct a lab called the signal lab that's situated grounding in natural language. If you, click the link here in the slides will take you to my lab, my lab webpage. When I'm not doing CS, I spend a lot of time doing distance running I've run nine marathons most recently in Chicago I play music if you find me on Instagram you might find me banging out the occasional guitar solo. Here's my wife. Here's my daughter here my three cats. My daughter's in daycare. What this means if any of you have children or familiar with young children is that she's bringing back a fresh cocktail of diseases every week. So I recently just got over a stomach bug thankfully I recovered in time to teach in person. So, just fair warning that you know I will try my best not to get sick of course I'm definitely trying best not to get you sick. But there may be times that I'm not available. Worst case scenario I'll have to cancel class at some point because I'm just like under the weather for whatever reason. Hope that's not the case. We also see the thing plus some on the way so just to note about that we are expecting our second kid. So, we're going to be in the middle of May. Yay. We are very excited. Although I'm also thinking about how tired I am going to be. I just want to note that the due date might not so it's coming in late May. So, this should not impact the schedule of this class. My daughter came a couple of weeks early, she came in June. I think she's pretty well with the school schedule. But just in case you know, if he comes early like in my land kind of during finals week but still wouldn't impact this class, but there's a chance that especially like as things go on you know I'm going to have to take my wife to the doctor a whole lot so my availability may become less as the semester goes on. I just want to make you aware of that. And occasionally there may be instances where I have to cancel office hours because of you know I have to be able to go to an OB appointment or something like that. Just fair warning about that. Okay, so course principles. You're all adults. This is a college course. You are here to learn. I expect you to be able to demonstrate your learning, and I expect you to act like adults that is you know be respectful. I'm going to go up. Make an effort on the assignments. I'm just saying all this, I've never had a problem with any of this before in any of my classes I don't expect there to be a problem here and just sort of stating it as a derigger. So the organization of the course they're going to be two primary hubs there's a canvas page that I hope you all have got access to. If you don't, for some reason please let me know. The way to contact me is through canvas because that allows me to keep all the course messages, you know, collected, and I don't miss things in my inbox. If you don't have access to the can for some reason please let me know me because I can fix that. There's also the course page, which I should show you briefly. So here if you go to CS to college data edu slash total CS 445. So take you to this semester's version of it on it you will see pretty much the same content as the slides. I just recommend that you check this regularly. So I will update this with my office hours and Cyrus. And then if you click on calendar, we will basically see the structure of the course, all of these are these accessible pages and working that one I had problems with this one works okay. Some reason I'm not trying to fix that but it's just a slide deck. If you click on this you can get to the notebooks that we will use so you can run them yourself. You may expect to see minor updates in these. Those usually, you know will be posted before class so, but the, what you see here is pretty much current on the schedule might change. You know it's spring semester sometimes we have snow days and stuff like that so in that event we may have to move things around a little bit. So throughout all of this content. There's a couple of things at the end that are not, you know, once we get through kind of dimensionality reduction. I do some stuff on you know, non neural methods, and also do a brief introduction transformers. These two can be sacrificed if necessary, although I would like not to do that because I particularly enjoy doing the intro to transformers. So this is the event to say a snow day or something you may have to move things around by a day or two. So just check the check the calendar you know it's coming up and so that you also know if any assignments or do more than do is changed. There's no textbook. There are some free resources that you can download here. So these books, these resources are very good if you want to know more about mathematics you want to know other applications. So the books are not required. So the contents of the class will be entirely self contained in the notebooks, but for further further reading, you know you definitely can consult these. Okay. So, of course organization. Yes, on the course page, if you just saw you'll see the calendar, you'll see the notebooks you'll see the assignments. Canvas is going to be for supplementary material and say if there's a reading I want you to do primarily it's going to be for discussions. So this is the place for mostly you to discuss amongst yourselves about the assignments. So, what does it mean to help each other with the assignments you may consult about the problem you may not share code. It's basically the rule of thumb here. I will set it so that students can start Canvas discussion board so like if you do something in the assignment that you have a question about started discussion about it and anyone who knows the answer to that can can answer that. Just remember that like I can see everything you post there so don't go sharing code or do doing stupid things right this is not private. So, the reading structure. So there are six programming assignments. This is the majority of your grade 80% there worth 100 points each. Then you also get a final project. This is worth 15% of your grade. And then the remaining 5% of class participation class participation is kind of conditional upon the modality which are taking this class I know we have some people who are online there's some people are also taking it asynchronously. So basically, class participation if I know that you are engaged, you can assume you will get full participation points in a class like this what does that mean. Usually, if by the end of the semester if I can put a face to the name, except for those of you who I know already. They usually means you're in a good place. Right so if this if in the class of like 8090 people if I learn your name at the end of the semester, you know, no offense it means you're, you're probably doing a good job of making yourself known if you aren't. Then, if I don't know your name, then it's probably suggest that maybe you should be a little more engaged. So, you know, come to office hours ask questions speak up in class. Post on the discussion boards there are many different ways to get class participation. Okay, programming assignments basically you're going to be given some data and some starter code. Everything will be done in Jupiter notebooks. So make sure you know how to use those. You can assume that we will be running probably Python 3.9. So, if you need if you need no version of Python, I would assume 3.9 people, not in this class and nlp submitted 310 assignments which caused a couple of issues, we had to debug. And so if you use Python 3.10, I just recommend you let us know that so that we can take that into consideration. If say something is not working. We will be using automated grading so when you're given the assignment you'll be given a greater script. This is the script that we run for the coding part of the assignment. And so what you can do is then you can make sure that your code passes all the unit test before you submit. And so as long as you run on an environment that is similar enough to ours and doesn't have any wild dependencies installed I mean like really wild out there we've tried this in multiple environments. Doesn't matter whether you run on Linux or Windows or Mac, you know, as long as as long as you pass the autograder it should work. Your code needs to run given what is asked for in the submission so don't go installing some weird special package. For example, use the scikit learn implementation of linear regression to write linear regression assignment that's not the point. If we see that you will be in major trouble. Also don't use any weird arcane packages that we may not have installed in our systems if we have to install that we will get unhappy and we will pass that unhappiness on to you. So you get partial credit for code and then partial credit for the experiments that you do in the explanation so generally, you have to fill out some functions to complete an algorithm, you have to run that algorithm on some data, and you have to discuss your results. Usually the split between code and discussion is roughly 5050. And so this ensures that people cannot say just skim on the discussion and then pass the class of the 90% just writing the template code. So you have to demonstrate your learning, and you do that by being able to discuss the experiments that you do and the results. So, leads me to the question of, are you learning versus are you chasing a grade. So, in this class ask yourself what's more important. Are you here to get an a, or are you here to learn something. Some people are here to fill a requirement. But that's not most of you. And so, I assume you were here to learn machine learning. So how are you going to demonstrate that. So, are you writing yourself ragged before a certain score are you staying up until three o'clock in the morning, getting no sleep and mainline and coffee into your veins to get 100%. Or are you doing it because you actually want to meet the challenge of the assignment. Right. And this should be because you're telling you the answer because you want to meet the challenge of the assignment if you are doing fine. And you have concerns I will let you know if I think you're doing fine in the class you're worried about your grade, but I spoke in my grade book. Yeah, you're getting like a 97 or something I'll tell you that you're well positioned. So yeah, I have questions just ask. So, in my first perspective, in my first AI course I got a C plus. I feel like things have worked out okay. So, I went to DePaul University in Chicago and I took AI programming, got a C plus I recently learned that my professor there moved from DePaul to see you Boulder. And it's now the department chair at the Department of Information Sciences, and he wants to peer in the news. So I sent him an email like, Hey, remember when I got a C plus in 2008 well now I'm a professor machine learning at CSU. And he's like, Yeah, great, great to hear from you to come down and give a talk sometime. So, I guess my point here is don't hang up on the grade too much. Because in your future career be a graduate school or employment. They're not going to care the specific grade you got machine learning they're going to know that you can apply the techniques. So like, if you get an A minus it's not the end of the world you can get a B plus it's not the end of the world. Okay. What I just said. Okay, my grading style has been described as more than fair. If you speak to people who have had me as an instructor. One place that I am stingy I don't give a pluses. That is, the A plus is meaningless in in college for truly exceptional performance that is greater than 100% which is possible to do. I will give an A plus. But my rant is that a pluses are meaningless at the college level they do nothing for GPAs and still four points. And this should be abolished because if I don't state this up front people start knocking down my door, ask me why they're 97.8 wasn't a plus. Here's why. All right, the one commandment of this class. So I feel like we have to let me have to lay this out now. I'll shout not use chat GPT to help you with your writing in this class. Okay. How am I going to enforce this. Well, it's going to be difficult, but I what I'm going to be doing I'm going to be reading your writing very closely. Okay. Chat GPT, as I've said before, writes like a high school or who's bsing an essay 15 minutes before class. If you write like a high school or who's bsing an essay 15 minutes before class you probably shouldn't be in college. Okay. And I assume that all of you can write better than this and I expect you to demonstrate that writing does not have to be perfect does not have to be free of spelling or grammar errors. It has to be understandable has to help me, you know, walk through what you did. But don't use the agent to help write your code. Also, it wouldn't do very well at this I suspect because it doesn't have the context. It doesn't have the code that you wrote. It doesn't have the experiments that you ran. So it's not going to be able to discuss that. The exception to this. Some of you may be interested in doing a final project on chat GPT. And that's perfectly acceptable. That's actually great. I would really be interested in seeing some project like that. In that case, one thing that you may want to do would be feeding example inputs into chat GPT and analyzing the output. Right. So, chat GPT as the object of study is one thing versus trying to use chat GPT to actually do the assignment. So that's clear. If you have any questions about what is or is not acceptable. Please feel free to come ask extension policy on assignments. I am willing to entertain extension requests as long as they're justified need to make these more than 24 hours before the assignment and deadline. And this is the assignment deadline for you. That is some people are granted accommodations that means their assignments are due at a different date from the one for the rest of the class. So you can factor that that extension in what you need to provide is your reason for requesting and a reasonable alternate date by which you can get the assignment done. Most people suggest you the you know, a day maybe 234 is pushing it, but you know, on with with justification that we consider that what I will then do is I will approve it, or I will deny it or I will present you with a counteroffer say like, you said Monday once you get in by Sunday instead. Okay. Also, if you act together. You've become much less easy to ignore, because if 20 of you say that you're having problems with the assignment, it probably generally means that it didn't allow enough time for the class at large to do the assignment. If one of you that says that my assumptions that you just started late but if you know, half the class says it it's probably more problem with the assignment than the person. And the skill just in general, you know, collective action will serve you well in life. Okay, you may be asking what constitutes a reasonable excuse. So generally this lies at the intersection of things that are specific to you and things that you have no control over. Okay, so what that means, you know, plan travel, right. This is specific to you, but you planned it before. You didn't allocate enough time to the assignment, obviously, you know, you could have started earlier. If you really want to go see the concert I haven't seen the concert in three years. I want to go see a concert. Okay. So, you know, I'm sorry. I know kidding. Hopefully we never face another situation like this but someone has did ask for an extension because Russia invaded Ukraine. Now specific to you you have no control over it. Russia invades Ukraine, but you're a first generation Ukrainian American and you have family in Ukraine right that's different. Okay, so you just need to let me know that and like that is something that would cause you know you specific distinct mental anguish that may impact your ability to do the assignment. So, you know, financial crisis right, everybody is suffering. There may be things that have to be done with the class at large in such a situation, let's say the, we rock it through the debt ceiling and the stock market crashes through the ground and everything is is going to be on recognition. There's still a worldwide pandemic. You know, I know some of you wearing masks I may on occasion wear a mask if I feel like it's warranted. So, we have collectively decided that this is not a reason to cancel class so you know we're going with it, but you know, your spouse asks for a divorce you didn't see it coming which also no control over it right you can definitely get an extension for that. So, you know, financial health crisis right something that you know you have no you may you may know there's something you deal with but you don't have any control over it right so that is still specific to you so that's legitimate. You get hit by a bus, right don't go do not actively go hit by a bus to get an extension. But if it happens, you know, please let me know or have your friend let me know. I'm going to try to provide some documentation. If you get COVID right and you're down, you know I've been there I've had COVID, you're down for like three days and just really can't focus. Then I understand so just be communicative about this. Okay. Okay office hours currently I have them set for 330 to 430 Tuesdays and Thursdays that is after class. I, it on occasion I have moved them around sometimes it just turns out there's another time that works better I find I don't like that hour or something. But in the past having office hours and same day as class is actually enabled me to keep one day mostly free for writing which is worked well. So I will post these on the website. Okay, so for office hours, please notify me that you intend to come. This prevents me from double booking, but also if no one shows up that saves me an hour to do something else which is great. So office hours are reserved for things to do with class. So if you come if you come to office hours please make it about class. I'm sitting there expecting people to come about class so I generally I don't allow you know my students to book during office hours for example. So you can go outside of class or you can't make office hours for some reason. I have this booking tool so if you go to Krishna Swami dot you can book dot me. Basically this will go directly into my calendar and you can book a 20 minute slot. If you can't make office hours, or you want to talk to me about something else you know you want to talk about research or something that's not related to class. You can, you can set this. If you do book please do show up because then I make sure to be there and if someone doesn't show up having booked and I sat there wasting 20 minutes and I just getting out about it. So, and that will that will color my impression of you right as a flake. So don't do that. If you need to cancel let me know and I will move my calendar. So, without policy, everybody gets one. So, there are six programming assignments, and you can drop one of them from your final grade without any justification you can just say, I will ask everybody if you want to drop an assignment you can say I want to drop assignment five or something. So I will put this out when I'm doing grades the end of the semester, you're not required to drop any assignments some people do really well and want that reflected in their grade. But also it can be for any reason or no reason whatsoever. You can be unhappy with the 99% you got or you just couldn't get out of bed that day or that was a rough week or you know you just didn't get the assignment, but you must submit something for that assignment. I say something anything in parentheses. Just make sure that boxes full. Okay, empty. It's a zero. If there's something in there, I can drop it. So there's no option to drop class participation or the final product. Okay, note on prereqs so the assumption is that you've taken CS 345. This is now officially a prerequisite. For the past couple years it's kind of in flux we had both of these machine learning courses that were run separately and in parallel. Now CS 345 is officially prerequisite. There are some people who I've granted override for this course because you have, you know, demonstrated that you know Python. So the reason that I assume that people have taken 345 is basically I assume you know Python, I assume you know Python and numpy. We're not going to spend time teaching Python. If you don't know Python, that is you didn't take 345 or 152 is the other one that does Python. You will find at the very least you will find this to be a steep learning curve. If you think you can learn Python effectively within the first week, then go ahead and stick it out and see if you know you can, you can make it through the first assignment if you can then things will probably be okay. If that's not you that I do suggest you take CS 445 next year instead after having acquired sufficient facility in Python. All right. So attendance and policies. So, for in class attendance this means attending in class or if we're all remote for some reason on the zoom zoom is for the online students, or if you know you can request that you be allowed to attend by zoom for some reasons, that's not going to be a problem for me in any circumstances. Recorded lectures are for review for those people who have cleared it with me previously that they have some long standing conflict like a full time job. But in general, this is not intended to be a substitute for attending occasional absences are of course, you know, expected and allowed. I just asked for some notification. I have had exceptions on a case by case basis so I granted to you and only you so if I granted to your friend or roommate that doesn't also apply to you. You have to request it separately. And you'll know because I will say yes that's fine. And I will keep all the email so I have a record. Okay, COVID-19 this is the. Fourth semester they've taught where I've had this slide. COVID-19 is still with us even in the year 2023 University just sent out some updated guidance about COVID policy is just basically like, please watch the announcements and we'll tell you if anything changes so it's just sort of shrugged and you know they'll let us know if if they're going to do anything. Basically just watch out for updated guidance and we will follow the updated guidance in the university. You know, just take the necessary steps to protect yourself and others, you know, as you see fit and just be aware that things might change quickly. If you have coded, right, don't come to class. If I have coded class will be all remote listening that I'm on my feet and such and so on. So, this is a pandemic integrity policy this really should be pretty straightforward. Don't plagiarize, like, not even once plagiarism is not a legal crime but in academia it is the highest crime you can commit. And for plagiarism is basically automatic failure on the assignment, plus an additional deduction. That is, the punishment for having found to plagiarize has to be simply worse than not just doing the assignment. And if you're just a zero you basically get another x points deducted from your grade, which would be determined by myself. And then maximum penalty would be failure in the course or if you're actually if you're a grad student possible dismissal from your program so don't do this. And I have not encountered many instances where people have plagiarized and I don't expect that to be the case I'm just throwing this up there as a warning so you know what would happen if you did. So, the Constitution's plagiarism being copied is equivalent to beat to copy in this case, assuming that it is, it is intentional. So that is, if you intentionally copy off of someone you're found to do so that's plagiarism. If someone steals your homework and they, and you don't know about it you're not liable but if you share it, you are. So hopefully that is clear so when you were consulting with each other, make sure that you're not showing each other code, but you can work through you know toy examples and the problem that I encourage you to work together to learn I think that's that's a useful technique. Just make sure that you know where the line is and you don't don't get anywhere close to that line. So, you know, the if you're willing to show your solution you get the same penalties the person who copied off of you basically it. So, I think we should use this as a strategy to win friends influence people because I'm not going to be influenced is that except for giving you a zero on the assignment and talking from your grade. All right, my least favorite slide. So, as your instructor, I'm a mandatory reporter. What this means is that if I feel that there are just a risk of threats of harm to yourself or others reports of discrimination or sexual harassment. I'm not going to report them. What this means is, you know, don't put fuck this I want to die in your code comments, basically. So, you know, this is almost definitely a joke. Right, it's assignment for its March the weather is miserable, and the assignments not working. And like I feel you here. Just because that's the case. I still have to file a whole report if you do this because in that you know 1% chance that you actually do want to die at there's a risk that you are going to harm yourself. If I don't report it and then you come to harm, then I could lose my job and the university can be in big trouble. Okay, so I'm just saying, you know, even in jest, don't express your frustration this way there are other more productive outputs, and also don't threaten people, right, do not make earnest threats of harm, you know, do not behave inappropriately toward people any of these things I'm required to report again, not something that I've had a problem with before. Bottom line communication is key. It is always better to ask about something if you are unsure so if X is allowed, you know, ask me and I will tell you, do you want an extension, you know, give me reasons why and I'll tell you if something is wrong right if you feel, you know, I feel like the class is going too fast or too slow or I speaking too fast sometimes I do that. Just let me know. But basically if you, you know, if you feel you're not being respected or something like that, you know, also let me know so if you feel something is not right. The first thing you should be doing is talking to me about it. Because if you say nothing I'm going to assume that nothing is wrong. Okay. And my promise to you is that I will listen to your concerns and take them seriously. So, any questions about the class policies. Okay. Oh, yes. Yeah. Are you going to go over that like today or a second. So let's go to the old, I'll nail it down later. Let's just go back to the course schedule so you get a sense of kind of where things stand. So this is, you know, as I said, roughly, roughly final. So you will notice that you get about a week, a week and a half something up to two weeks for close to two weeks for each assignment project proposal is basically going to be rolled out mid March. So the project comes in three parts. So basically there's a proposal that you have just a little bit of time to basically write a short, very brief description of what you want to do. And I'll outline, you know, what the parameters are basically you can do a research report or a coding project. And then the last two days of class before the final final deliverable is due, we're going to have a lightning presentations that is every group will come give usually comes out to about a minute and a half to two minute. Talk about your project. So this is a three or four I will check. And then in the last two days of class before the final final deliverable is due, we're going to have a lightning presentations that is every group will come give usually comes out to about a minute and a half to two minute. Talk about your project. And these are very simple sort of, here's my problem. Here's what I've done so far and here's, or here's what I've learned. But I'll, if you have questions about the project, let me know, but we're going to nail it, the specifics down and you can leave go to this and basically see what the requirements are ahead of time if you want to start thinking about what you want to do. Okay, so you're free to start brainstorming the kind of projects you want to do ahead of time, we will be using pi torching class but like your free use TensorFlow and other libraries and your, your project proposal. So the project requirements are like, a lot less restrictive than the assignment requirements you get a lot more freedom to kind of maximize your own success. Any other questions. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, the project on I guess this is an addendum to research so the, the product the project. If you have like an existing line of research. You can make the project kind of adjacent to that. It just has to be relevant to the class, but because the class is machine learning. Right. There's a lot of ways that you can make whatever research you're doing relevant to machine learning you apply some machine learning technique to your area specialty, for example. So it's not be hard to do. My goal is not to add more work to your planks I know a lot of you are very busy so if you have some existing research project that you want this to to form a part of you know I'm happy to consider that. Other questions. Okay. So I suspect we will probably be able to end today somewhat early. What I will do is let me connect to the GPU machine. So a GPU is not required for this class, although it does help. That's not my password. But we will be running Jupyter notebooks on the GPU, and it will help for some assignments to just make it will make it go faster. But if you don't have access to GPU don't sweat it. But also remember that because you're enrolled in this class, even if you're not a CS student you should have access to remote access to department CS department machines, and we have a bunch of them have GPUs on them. So maybe you can tell people how to remote access them we also have last year's TA also did a tutorial about running Jupyter notebooks remotely on the department machines that I will post. Just so you're aware of all the the full spectrum of resources available to you. All right, so the course review, the beginning of this is basically the slide. And the late policy I didn't mention. So in the extension policy, the flip side of that is the late policy you get a 10 point deduction for every 24 hours that it's late. Grace period is roughly you know if you turn in really early in the morning. Generally, I'm going to let that slide I tend to get up very early so if I see your assignment when I get up. I'm not able to assume it was submitted the night before so it's like, you'll get in by midnight be getting by 1240. I wouldn't sweat that too much. I'll probably let it slide. After that every 24 hours, it's 10 points. So not like 10% 10% 10% basically you know minus 10 minus 10 minus 10 off the percentage okay. This, if you get an extension, and then you're late past that extension that's in the late policy starts to apply. Okay. So again, don't worry. I keep track of everything it's all done automatically in canvas. And if you have questions I will be happy to answer them. Basically, just talk to us about that. Don't ask your extension the night before make sure that you do it at least for an hour. Yeah use the canvas inbox for mail, allow me to keep it separate and have it not get lost. Okay, so examples of the kinds of problems that we're going to study. So basically the usual suspects and machine learning that you may have been exposed to before digit classification, I will spend a lot of time in the m this data set if you know what that is, you know predicting miles per gallon from other factors about cars playing tic tac to using reinforcement learning. And then, I'm not sure if this gene expression want to still in the unsupervised learning notebook but I will check. But this may be a topic of a project for some of you. Okay, first thing that you need to do. I recommend that you install the anaconda distribution. If you don't have a Python or Jupiter distribution installed already. And then the scipy lecture notes is a good initial reading to kind of get started to try some examples to make sure that you know how how scipy works basic, you know, Python numpy functionality and how it all runs in a Jupiter notebook. Okay, so first thing we're going to do is just go through the execution of our first Jupiter notebook. First we can see I'm just going to do my standard imports import sis. This allows me to print the Python version. And so now we'll see we're running on version 3.9.7. Every Python function file begins with a standard set of imports that you're going to be using, you know, and usually the first thing you're going to see is import numpies and P import matplotlib.piplot as PLT. So numpies is numerical Python. This basically allows us to create vectors and easily manipulate vectors. And then P plot is just a standard plotting library. And then import torch is going to be import pi torch, which is the machine learning library that we're going to be spending most of the time. Yes. The examiner is allowed for us to use the pandas as well or just numpies. No, you can use pandas. Yeah. So you'll, we'll go through, we'll go through the notebooks and you'll see like some of the standard things that we use. And you'll get starter code that usually that will include all these, these imports. And you can use, you can add other imports as long as they're like standard Python libraries or just like something that every user can expect to have installed on their machine. So, you know, use pi plot, not seaborne, for example, I love seaborne looks great. But don't assume that it is going to have it. Okay. So first thing we are doing here, but just going to check and see if this machine has a GPU. So you can do torch dot CUDA dot is available, and it will print either true or false. So here, this is my Mac doesn't have an immediate GPU on it, but the my lab machine does so I'm running this remotely on my lab machine. And so when I run torch dot CUDA is available. It prints out true. So what we'll do then is we will be able to compare the execution of some operations using Python on the GPU versus Python just on the CPU. So here what I'll do is I'll just initialize to uniform distributions 5000 by 5000. And so then if I initialize these, and then I'll just perform the modular operator over these so these are created using NP dot random by uniform which means they're going to be created as an umpire a so an N by N umpire a since and it's 5000 this should create to 5000 by 5000 umpire a that are filled with a randomly sampled decimal numbers. Okay, so if I run this and takes a little bit. So, size of a is 5000 by 5000 so 25 million size of B is also 25 million. And then if I just print C equals a modular be and then print that you'll see this is the operate the output of the modular operator performed element wise over these two very large arrays. Okay, so the size of a mod B is going to also be 25 million. So, just to point out a fact about tensors versus and dimensional arrays how many of you have heard the term tensor before. Many of you. How many of you have not heard the term tensor before. A few of you, and that's perfectly okay. So, the specifics we're not going to get into exactly the differences between tensors and and dimensional arrays in this class but both tensors and end the arrays are multi dimensional rays. So, it's not exactly the same. Okay, in that tensors are more generalized a tensor and an array of the same dimensionality that is the rank will behave somewhat differently. One way to think about this is to kind of use this analogy, a linear transformation. So basically if I take some data and I stretch it or rotate it or I move it can be performed using a matrix. So, this is going to be in the next couple of notebooks. And then a tensor is also an operation in this sense. But a multi dimensional array is a data structure that's suitable for representing this operation. So, the numpy, you know, numpy uses and dimensional rays and all packages use tensors, and there are neat tools to just transfer back and forth between these, if all you need at the numbers. So, for purposes of execution and operation in this class, you don't need to worry about this distinction. All you need to know is that in order to use things in pie torch things need to be of the tensor data structure, whereas if you're just writing a neural network in numpy, just using an end dimensional array will do. These can be transferred between each other, but you can't use a n dimensional ray in an operation that's expecting a tensor, it's going to throw an error. And then you can just go throw an error that tells you it's not a tensor and it needs to be a tensor. So, what we're going to do here now is that I'm going to take a and B, which were n dimensional arrays that I created earlier. And I'm just going to use the torch dot from numpy command to turn them into the tensor versions of those same numbers. So AT and BT will now be the tensor versions of those randomly initialize matrices that we had before. And this is dot to command, and you can pass values into this that are either CUDA or CPU CUDA is the GPU acceleration library by Nvidia. And this is what allows ML computations on GPUs to proceed faster. And so, one trick here is that in order to use these on the CUDA device everything has to be actually be kind of relocated in memory onto that device so by running the two command I now have versions of AT and BT, that are actually on the CUDA device. And so now, if I run a mod or a mod B over the tensor versions, I can get the output. And you may have observed, if you're paying attention that this happened almost instantaneously, and the element lies version over the NumPy arrays took about a second, right took a little bit. And so, you can see that CUDA is allowing us to perform this operation quite a bit faster. How much faster you may ask, well let's find out. So if we import time this allows to keep track of the time. So here's now this is now just a numerical representation of the current time in continuous load form. And so now what I'll do is I'll see, I'll start the time and then I'll compute the time to complete the execution for both of these operations. Right. And so you can see that NumPy took about 0.45 seconds and PyTorch on the GPU took less than one tenth of that. And in fact, if you run it repeatedly, you may find that the difference gets even more true. Okay, so if I run this more, you know, 0.44 versus 0.0003. So, CUDA is a whole lot faster. So, just a demonstration of the utility of GPUs. How did we end up here with GPUs. I think we will get to that in the next notebook that I'll do real quickly. Let me see if I do not actually. I'll go through that at the end. So, now let's try to visualize this. So we just saw how fast the comparison between NumPy and PyTorch on the GPU is. Let's actually see what kind of speed up we get using different data sizes and where we actually start to get a real value add from CUDA. So, same imports. This time going to import statistics. Same, just, you know, good practice to run this whenever you are using a new machine, or even the same machine just to make sure the GPU hasn't something gone offline. So, now we'll try a bunch of different trials. So you will see, if you compare this code to the previous version, it's basically the same right I'm creating two and dimensional arrays, and then I'm moving them to, to tensors, and moving them to the GPU. And the only difference here is that now instead of doing an element wise mod operation, I'm actually going to use this at sign, which is matrix multiplication. We'll get into specifics of matrix multiplication. How many of you are already familiar with matrix multiplication. I hope many of you. Okay, good. So I don't need to go into that in any real depth. So basically, what, what is matrix multiplication. What do we do. We take a rule of one, early and multiply with the column of the other one. Exactly. So, if I take two 5000 by 5000 arrays multiply them together. What is the shape of the output. Right. And why is that. So if I have say a three by two array multiplied by a two by four array was three by four right so basically take, basically taking those those the two inner elements must both quite together, and the result is in the two other elements. If I have a three by two array and try to multiply it by a five by two array what happens. It won't work. We'll get an error. We'll see that. And that you'll see that in practice and that's like almost the most common error that people have on their assignments is like the shapes of your arrays are not correct. So, what I'll do here is I will try, you know, from sizes of 2000 to 10,000 I'm going to create arrays of these different sizes, and then try to perform matrix multiplication over them. And then I will plot the time it takes in num pi and the time it takes in pytorch. And then we'll actually be able to visualize the difference. So, this will run, you know, it will take a while, because mostly because num pi is kind of slow. So now we are at n equals 7000 and equals 8000. And you can already see, you know, kudos 10 times faster kudos nine times faster kudos eight times faster. So, you can see the comparisons here, but this is not necessarily the most intuitive way to view this we can get some average statistics on average num pi took point four four seconds and average pytorch is very slightly faster, but then pytorch on the GPU is significantly faster. So now we actually plot these. Let's get the results for each type of operation, just convert them to arrays to make sure they're plottable. I now have eight samples for each, and then three types of computation that I tried. So now let's plot them. And here's the result. And so you can see the orange line is plain torch the blue line is num pi and the green line is pytorch or is is CUDA. And then we zoom out a little bit. And you can see what a difference that makes. Right. So, big advantages to using CUDA. You will know that the value add doesn't really start to appear until the data size increases right there's a relatively negligible difference between the two when we're just using like the same samples by the time they get 3000 5000 up to 10,000. Wow. Right. So now you hopefully can just understand intuitively why GPU computations are are a benefit. And so now we can just look at the seconds to multiply two matrices. And here is your result. So, how do we get to this point with with GPUs. Anybody know, kind of the history of machine learning and why neural networks has only taken off well not suddenly over the last decade of taking off. So when did the first neural network come into existence. Yeah. So it's not not bad guess any any other thoughts. Sorry was that. Yeah, 60s. 60s. Okay, any other. Any guess. Yeah, so the first neuron I forget the exact date the McCulloch pits neuron. I don't think it was 1947 might have been 1957. So, but then the that neuron is basically just a single unit that takes an input forms transformation gets now but neural neural neural networks have been around for quite a while I think actually the first like networks probably the 60s I think I forget the exact date. But they didn't do much for a very long time. In the 70s 80s, there are some demonstrations at MIT of kind of doing some like you know, digit recognition type things. And I knew you may know it was a godfather deep learning was actually involved in that back then. And so it was kind of a cool party trick like wow I can get a computer to recognize a digit and I don't have to like hard code the shape of the digit into it. But it took you know a main frame about the size of this room, and it could only do that. Right is was the one trick pony. And it, you know, really wasn't really impressive if you poked at it beyond the, the simple things that it could do. The real reason was that it's really was due to a lack of data. But now we look at, say within the last decade. A couple of interesting things have happened one with the internet. There's all sorts of data available it's really easy to access it's easy to crowdsource. So the amount of data available to create models has grown. What has happened is that GPU chips have become available. And so for this we can actually thank the gaming industry, because GPUs were originally developed to accelerate rendering of better graphics on your gaming consoles and things like that. What do these two things have in common do you have any didn't really know anything about the relation between graphics and machine learning. Yeah. Exactly. So, how do I if I have a vector that is pointing to say a simple vector one zero zero pointing off to the right, and want to transform it into a vector that points, you know, 001 to the front. Well, a simple way I can do that you can actually create a matrix that represents that transformation. You can create a matrix that represents an arbitrary transformation between any two vectors. So this happens three dimensions. And that's the use of of GPUs in performing basically chips that are optimized for performing vector math, made graphics rendering much more, much more easy and basically creates a, you know, creates the visual quality of modern games. But if you can do it in three dimensions, you can do it in 500 dimensions. And so it just takes a little bit of extra compute. And so, no, we're not training chat GBT as fast as we're rendering a game or not doing it 60 frames a second. But just, I can take the same technology that performs a transformation over three dimensional vector and perform it over a 1768 dimensional vector is just going to go slower, but no one's expecting to be able to train chat GBT at 60 frames a second that's not the point. So GPU is kind of arrived right at this moment where we had enough data to feed into these things and the acceleration to make training them not take eons. And so now the back propagation operations will go into when we talk about neural networks. Suddenly these very small updates can be done really really fast and at scale. And so performing is really small updates over these coefficients need to be optimized neural network can now be done in a reasonable time with reasonable resources for a given definition of reasonable. And boom, we have all of modern machine learning. So that's machine learning history in a nutshell I guess. And I think, are there any questions about the material. Okay, so my last question for today. So, and when I was in high school. And we had to buy those TI graphing calculators and like my parents were put out because they had to spend 100 bucks on it and it's like, why, why doesn't school buy this for you. And then we saw how much teachers were paid and really go that's why. So, but you do you guys do that when you were in high school, you buy the graphing calculators. Do you remember in like algebra class, having to do linear regression with just like the linreg function, where your teacher was like okay you set up your data this way, and then you use the linreg function and does the rest for you. Okay, so when reg obviously stands for linear regression. And that's the topic of the lecture that we're going to start on Thursday, and the topic of the first unit, and you will learn how to do the linreg function on your own. So, you can all look forward to that. And I see no need to keep you any longer if there are no questions so I hope. Hopefully we'll be back in person on Thursday we'll see what happens with the snow. But if for some reason remote then we'll meet remotely otherwise I will see you on Thursday. My head, or they're actually a class and kind of. I think we had some of those like in a bucket somewhere.
